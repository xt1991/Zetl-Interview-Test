### Datastructures

1. Describe differences between Array and Object in javascript.

- Objects represent a special data type that is mutable and can be used to store a collection of data (rather than just a single value). Arrays are a special type of variable that is also mutable and can also be used to store a list of values
- What are the best uses cases for Object? -> Objects are used to represent a “thing” in your code
- What are the best uses cases for Array? -> using arrays whenever we want to create and store a list of multiple items in a single variable. Arrays are especially useful when creating ordered collections where items in the collection can be accessed by their numerical position in the list

2. Describe differences between Map and Set in javascript.

- Map is a collection of keyed values. Set is a collection of unique values.

- What are the best uses cases for Set? -> to create object with many key same a value
- What are the best uses cases for Map? -> to create object with unique values.

3. Describe some applicable examples of using a tree data structure.

- I think there is i need go home after day work , I need find the shortest way from my company to my house, need choose turn left or right and go on like this

### Algorithms

1. Write a program that will generate all alphanumeric [a-z0-9] 6 digit sequences.

- Run "node index.js"

2. How many different alphanumeric codes with length 6 could be generated?

- There is 2.176.782.336 different combinations

3. How many different case sensitive alphanumeric codes [A-Za-z0-9] with length 6 could be generated?

- There is 56.800.235.584 different combinations

4. Optional: Update existing program to generate codes of variable length. eg. `generateCodes({ length: 10 })`

- Run "node index.js 10 "
